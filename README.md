# A-landscape-diagram-for-Python-data
This project is an interactive, data-driven landscape designed to visually map the Python ecosystem in a clear, structured, and intuitive way. Rather than presenting information as static lists or documents, it transforms complex technical domains into an explorable visual system where relationships, and concepts are immediately understandable.
